with it was fantastic.”

sentiment is generally a sentiment towards an aspect or a problem.
If we look at the subtheme sentiments of the above review we will get a clearer sense what these
generally are.

of the service that can be positive or negative while
Incorrect Tyres Sent denotes a problem, something inherently negative.

their respective sentiments.

Python Developer for Excel File Data Extraction,$8-15 USD / hour,"I'm in need of a proficient Python developer who can design functions enabling automation of data entry tasks. The job involves extracting rules and descriptions from Excel files, with varying types of data including both numerical and textual. 

Ideal skills and experience:
- Expertise in Python
- Experience with Excel and automating data entry
- Understanding of diverse types of data, both numerical and textual

This is the type of services I am looking for:

You must use the Excel file ""[login to view URL]"", available on the following website : [login to view URL]
The ""Bilateral [login to view URL]"" which uses the same format, should also be supported by your solution :
[login to view URL]


With these files, you must provide a way (the best would be a python function), from a heading number and an origin country, to get :
- a description (for example with a getDescription(heading_number,origin_country) function)
- a list of rules (there can be more than one rule per description), which give the preferential origin status (for example a getRules(heading_number,origin_country) function )

Consider the following example :
[login to view URL]
A call to getDescription(2007,Georgia) should return ""Jams, fruit jellies, marmalades, fruit or nut purée and fruit or nut pastes, obtained by cooking, whether or not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter""
A call to getRules(2007,Georgia) should return ""Manufacture from materials of any heading, except that of the product, and in which the value of all the materials of Chapter 17 used does not exceed 30 % of the ex-works price of the product""

However, the biggest challenge is the irregularity of the input files

Consider another example :
[login to view URL]

A call to getDescription(2008,Ecuador) should not directly return the description, but ask for a choice between the 3 possibles descriptions, that is  :
- ""Fruit, nuts and other edible parts of plants, otherwise prepared or preserved, whether or not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter or spirit, not elsewhere specified or included: Prepared or conserved palm hearts""
- ""Fruit, nuts and other edible parts of plants, otherwise prepared or preserved, whether or not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter or spirit, not elsewhere specified or included: Prepared or conserved palm hearts : Mixtures""
- ""Fruit, nuts and other edible parts of plants, otherwise prepared or preserved, whether or not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter or spirit, not elsewhere specified or included: Prepared or conserved palm hearts : Other""

The way to do this is left to be specified, but should be as simple an effort free as possible for the end user of getDescription.
In a similar way, a call to getRules(2008,Ecuador) shoud ask for a choice between the 3 possibles rules, which are directly related to the chosen description, that is :
- ""Manufacture in which all materials used are classified within a chapter other than that of the product, except for those of Chapter 12""
- ""Manufacture in which all materials used are classified within a chapter other than that of the product, except for those of Chapters 7""
- ""Manufacture in which all materials used are classified within a chapter other than that of the product provided that the value of all materials used does not exceed 50% of the ex–works price of the product""

In these files, there are a lot of irregularities of this kind. We are also asking for an exhaustive list of theses irregularities. For each of them, a solution should be proposed in a way that the end user of getDescription and getRule should have to make as little effort as possible, while getting the informations in the file in a reliable way.",https://www.freelancer.co.id/projects/python/python-developer-for-excel-file

Customization Functionality Overview
1.	Adjusting Product Page
o	""Customize"" Button: On each carpet product page, add a ""Customize"" button.
o	Popup Window/Modal: Clicking the ""Customize"" button opens a popup or modal where users can customize the carpet.
2.	Integrating Color Customization Tool
o	Frames for Customization: In the customization window, show frames around customizable areas (e.g., edges, patterns).
o	Interactive Frames: These frames should be clickable, allowing users to select and change the color of specific parts of the carpet.
3.	Real-time Color Display
o	Immediate Color Update: When a user selects a color, it should immediately reflect on the carpet in the customization window.
o	Real-time Feedback: Users should see real-time color changes as they select different colors.
4.	Saving Customized Colors
o	Session or Database Storage: Track selected colors using session variables or store them in the database linked to the user’s account.
o	Final Image Saving: Save the customized carpet image (without the frames) on the server.
5.	Adding to Cart and Placing Order
o	Order Integration: Include the customized colors in the order details when a user adds the carpet to their cart and places an order.
o	PHP Integration: Ensure that the customized carpet details are properly included in the existing PHP shopping cart environment.
Technology Requirements

Detailed Requirements

o	Frame-Specific Color Changes: Only the parts within the clicked frame should change color.
o	Color Code Input: Allow users to enter a color code (e.g., RGB or hex) in the color palette.
o	Final Image Saving: Save the final customized image without frames, as the final product will be handmade based on this image.
2.	Additional Developer Notes
o	Last Builder's Update: Check and resolve the following:
	Frames should display immediately after uploading.
	Allow color code input with a '#' for hex codes.
	Ensure sharp and precise color changes within frames, especially on carpets with complex designs.
	Implement the saving functionality so changes are stored on the server.
o	Performance: Optimize for GPU usage to improve performance on complex images.
o	Integration Readiness: Make sure the feature is fully ready for integration by our web developer into the Joomla shop.
Final Steps
1.	Review Existing Source Code: Ensure all required functionalities are present and working correctly.
2.	Enhance Segmentation: Improve segmentation for better performance on complex images.
3.	Implement Saving Mechanism: Ensure the customized image is saved correctly on the server and relevant variables are stored in session variables for further use by the webshop developer.

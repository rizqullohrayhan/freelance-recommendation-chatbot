---

في أحد الأيام الجميلة، في قرية صغيرة محاطة بالحقول الخضراء، كانت تعيش فتاة تدعى ليلى. كانت ليلى معروفة في قريتها بحبها الكبير للزهور، وكانت تعتني بحديقة صغيرة أمام منزلها تملؤها الورود والزهور المختلفة.

ذات يوم، بينما كانت ليلى تتجول في السوق المحلي، رأت بائع زهور يعرض ورودًا حمراء رائعة لم ترَ مثلها من قبل. تأملت في الوردة بحب وقالت للبائع: ""كم هي جميلة! أريد شراء واحدة منها."" ابتسم البائع وقال: ""هذه الوردة مميزة جدًا، فهي تحتاج إلى رعاية خاصة وإلا ستذبل بسرعة.""

وافقت ليلى على شراء الوردة وعادت إلى منزلها وهي تشعر بالحماس. وضعت الوردة في إناء جميل في غرفتها وقررت أن تعتني بها بكل حب واهتمام. كانت تسقيها بانتظام وتضعها في مكان مناسب حيث يمكنها الحصول على ما يكفي من الضوء.

مرت الأيام، وبدأت الوردة تزهر بشكل رائع وتنبعث منها رائحة زكية تملأ الغرفة. لكن في أحد الأيام، لاحظت ليلى أن الوردة بدأت تذبل رغم كل الرعاية التي كانت تقدمها. شعرت بالحزن ولم تفهم السبب.

توجهت ليلى إلى السوق مرة أخرى وسألت البائع عن السبب. قال البائع: ""الوردة تحتاج إلى شيء أكثر من الماء والضوء. إنها تحتاج إلى الحب والرعاية الصادقة."" فكرت ليلى في كلماته، وقررت أن تقضي وقتًا أكثر بجانب الوردة، تتحدث معها بلطف وتغني لها أغانيها المفضلة.

بمرور الوقت، بدأت الوردة تستعيد جمالها وتفتح بتلاتها بألوان أبهى من قبل. أدركت ليلى أن الحب والاهتمام هما السر الحقيقي في جعل الأشياء تنمو وتزدهر.
